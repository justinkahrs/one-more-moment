  items:
    - q: "What is a moment?"
      a: "Moments, or wishes, can be anything from visiting a long-lost friend, attending a sporting event or spending time with family at a favorite location. Moments are specific to the warrior and range in size and scope."
    - q: "Do I need to be a hospice patient to receive a wish?"
      a: "No, you do not. We grant wishes for warriors with Stage IV, advanced or metastatic cancer."
    - q: "Who qualifies for a wish?"
      a: |
        Our Warriors must:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Be diagnosed with Stage IV, advanced or metastatic cancer</li>
          <li>Live within the state of Michigan</li>
          <li>Lack the resources to fulfill the Moment themselves</li>
          <li>Provide a confirmation letter from their oncologist outlining their diagnosis and treatment</li>
        </ul>
    - q: "Where can I travel to on my wish?"
      a: "If the warrior's wish is to take a trip, we specialize in trips within the state of Michigan."
    - q: "Who can be part of my moment?"

    - q: "What if I have special medical needs?"
      a: "We do not assist with medical needs, such as ambulance transportation, oxygen, medical equipment, nurses and aids, dialysis, etc. We do not arrange or provide hospice care away from home, dialysis treatments or oxygen needs, but if you are traveling outside your Hospice providers area, we will work with the hospice provider where you're traveling in case of emergency."

  story:
    title: "Our Story"
    intro: |
      Jason and his mother regularly visited the local coffee shop to spend time together and catch up on life’s adventures. It was something just the two of them shared and they both looked forward to it each week throughout the years.

      One day in September 2013, she looked at him and mumbled a familiar request:
    quote: "“Do you want to go and grab a cup of coffee?”"
    outro: |
      The advanced cancer had rendered her body weak, tired and all but immobile. She required assistance for sitting up, a wheelchair to move greater distances and oxygen tank to breath. Jason knew grabbing coffee would be no small task as getting her out of the house would be impossible without the assistance of others.

      When she died a few days later, the feeling of helplessness in that moment stayed with Jason.

      Knowing he didn’t have the resources to provide his mother one last coffee date broke his heart. Something so simple that they had shared so many times was now unobtainable forevermore.

      It is out of that sense of helplessness that One More Moment was founded. To give hope in a time of need and provide last “moments” which cancer fighters and their families will cherish forever.
  whatWeDo:
    title: "What We Do"
    content: |
      One More Moment is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit located in Ann Arbor created to help give local late stage cancer warriors and their families an opportunity to have one more special moment together. To some, like Jason and his mother, it could be a cup of coffee at a local shop; to others it could be one last trip to Lake Michigan, one more football game, one more picnic in a park, a visit to sentimental place, or a drive to see the sunset. They needn’t be extreme or “typical”. The key is for something special and unique for every individual & family; simply “their” moment to enjoy.

      Through our vast network of resources and generous donors & supporters, we work hand-in-hand with local organizations to ensure that late stage cancer warriors have their One More Moment.

        bio: "After losing his mother to cancer in September of 2013, Jason wanted to make a difference in the lives of cancer warriors. When he wasn’t able to provide his mother the simple last wish of going out for coffee, he knew there were others in the same situation. Since that day, Jason has worked tirelessly to provide late stage cancer warriors with their wish or moment."

        bio: "Since arriving in the United State from Eastern Europe in the 2nd Grade, Simone has been local to the Ann Arbor. Her passion for helping people, her strong faith, and her outgoing and uplifting personality has given her many opportunities over the years to connect with people of all ages, backgrounds with various personal life experiences. Simone lives by the belief that life is meant to be truly “lived”; that a written “vision” is more important that spoken goals, and that nothing is more powerful than a human soul on fire. That fire connected her with Jason and Ashley. But her passion for helping cancer patients and their loved ones to have one more moment together - gives her the energy to work and support the foundation and the exciting events, while still being a full-time working mom, a wife, a daughter, a sister to her 4 siblings, and a loyal friend to many. Simone also lost her beautiful aunt to cancer in March of 2015, as well as 2 close friends years back and she believes that the One More Moment Foundation is something that will help toward finding a cure for this dreadful disease, while in the meantime, it will help those suffering feel just a little more loved and special while still on this earth."
