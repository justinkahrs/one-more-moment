  items:
    - q: "WHAT IS A MOMENT?"
      a: "Moments, or wishes, can be anything from visiting a long-lost friend, attending a sporting event or spending time with family at a favorite location. Moments are specific to the warrior and range in size and scope."
    - q: "DO I NEED TO BE A HOSPICE PATIENT TO RECEIVE A DREAM?"
      a: "No, you do not. We grant wishes for warriors with Stage IV, advanced or metastatic cancer."
    - q: "WHO QUALIFIES FOR A DREAM?"
      a: |
        Our Warriors must:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Be diagnosed with Stage IV, advanced or metastatic cancer</li>
          <li>Live within the state of Michigan</li>
          <li>Lack the resources to fulfill the Moment themselves</li>
          <li>Provide a confirmation letter from their oncologist outlining their diagnosis and treatment</li>
        </ul>
    - q: "WHERE CAN I TRAVEL TO ON MY WISH?"
      a: "If the warrior's wish is to take a trip, we specialize in trips within the state of Michigan."
    - q: "WHO CAN BE PART OF MY MOMENT?"
      a: "One More Moment will fund Moments that include the cancer warrior and up to 3 family members or friends of the warriors choice. Additional individuals are welcome to join if space allows, but they will be responsible for their expenses."
    - q: "WHAT IF I HAVE SPECIAL MEDICAL NEEDS?"
      a: "We do not assist with medical needs, such as ambulance transportation, oxygen, medical equipment, nurses and aids, dialysis, etc. We do not arrange or provide hospice care away from home, dialysis treatments or oxygen needs, but if you are traveling outside your Hospice providers area, we will work with the hospice provider where you're traveling in case of emergency."
